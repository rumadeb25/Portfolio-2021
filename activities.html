            In a student organization called MedLaunch, I have worked on developing a method for quadriplegics and others with limited mobility of their arms who struggle to participate in painting independently. My team and I have designed an autonomous painting setup which works with motion sensors to dispense paint and is fully rotatable to allow artists to comfortably position their pallets.
            Included are sketches of proposed ideas and designs.

            I strive to implement innovation in healthcare because millions of people have difficulty utilizing a creative outlet to express themselves and relieve stress and anxiety. 
            For this project, I have worked with a community partner in the Ann Arbor area in order to design, build, and test the assistive technology for them. 
            It has been an iterative process in which I have learned to understand the partner and redefine solutions and strategies that might not have been initially apparent. 
            This design project creates an opportunity that could improve the health of many lives in our community and I have enjoyed applying human-centered techniques to solve problems in a creative, meaningful, and innovative way.
